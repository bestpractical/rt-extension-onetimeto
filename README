NAME
    RT::Extension::OneTimeTo - Adds a One-time To: box next to the One-time
    Cc/Bcc boxes

INSTALLATION
    This extension requires an RT version equal to or newer than 4.0.6. You
    may be able to get away with RT version 4.0.0 provided you have the 22
    May 2012 security patches applied to your RT install.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Optionally, patch your RT install
        This enables one-time recipient suggestions from past One-time To
        addresses (i.e. the checkboxes that appear under One-time
        To/Cc/Bcc):

            patch -p1 -d /opt/rt4 < patches/0001-Let-list-of-headers-used-for-one-time-recipient-sugg.patch

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::OneTimeTo));

        or add "RT::Extension::OneTimeTo" to your existing @Plugins line.

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver
